# Handwritten Digit Recognition
Hello viewrs, this is a research project of mine and my group members under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jl9HAJEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. B S Patro.</a>
<br><br><strong> Project Description </strong>
<ul>
  <li>The project allows a user to write in air, as one would write in notebook which is visualised using the opencv main window.</li>
  <li>If a number is written in the air, a deep learning system is embedded in back of the system that predicts the number and prints the answer in console.</li>
  <li>This project can be very useful for specific communication.</li>
  <li>The dl model is prepared using the tensorflow framework and the application is made using the opencv library.</li>
